# I will miss you as my coding teacher and friend.
# I hope that one day will come and I will see you again whether
# it be in real life or online once more.
# Thank you for what you have done to change my life for the
# future and the present.
# The year has gone by fast and too soon.
# I wish this wasn't our final class together, but for now,
# we must part ways.
# I hope to see you soon in the future.
